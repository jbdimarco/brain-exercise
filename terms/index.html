            <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <p>
                By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you &ndash;
                you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You&rsquo;re not allowed
                to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You&rsquo;re not allowed to
                attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn&rsquo;t try to translate the app into
                other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database
                rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Hack4Impact.
                <br><br>
                Hack4Impact is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
                possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at
                any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                clear to you exactly what you&rsquo;re paying for.
                <br><br>
                The Brain Exercise app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to
                us, in order to provide our Service. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
                secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
                could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone&rsquo;s
                security features and it could mean that the Brain Exercise app won&rsquo;t work properly or at all.
                <br><br>
                The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.
                <br><br>
                Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://policies.google.com/terms&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600482401860000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3yFpKQ2GTbCaylO-M7hAXW">
                            Google Play Services
                        </a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                You should be aware that there are certain things that Hack4Impact will not take
                responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
                The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Hack4Impact cannot take
                responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don&rsquo;t have access to Wi-Fi, and
                you don&rsquo;t have any of your data allowance left.
                <br><br>
                If you&rsquo;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that
                your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be
                charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
                app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you&rsquo;re accepting responsibility for any such
                charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or
                country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
                you&rsquo;re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
                payer for using the app.
                <br><br>
                Along the same lines, Hack4Impact cannot always take responsibility for the way you
                use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged &ndash; if it runs out of battery and
                you can&rsquo;t turn it on to avail the Service, Hack4Impact cannot accept responsibility.
                <br><br>
                With respect to Hack4Impact&rsquo;s responsibility for your use of the app, when
                you&rsquo;re using the app, it&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that
                it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we
                can make it available to you. Hack4Impact accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
                experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                <br><br>
                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on
                Android &amp; iOS &ndash; the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to
                extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you&rsquo;ll need to download the updates if you want
                to keep using the app. Hack4Impact does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is
                relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device.
                However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
                stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
                terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
            </p>
